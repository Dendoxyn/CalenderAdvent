make me an entire javafx programm, that is an advent calender with 24 "doors" where when you click one a window pops up with a little IT riddle

make the riddle way shorter and show everything

could you make the buttons more "christmasy"? And change the format to make it look prettier?

now some buttons are cut off, could you make the format even better?

no no i meant make the main stage have the right format and undo making the riddle a button

whenever i push or make pull request it should make an executable jar file, can you make this in a main.yml in [project]/.github/workflow/main.yml through github actions

is this possible to then include the file in github pages?

name all prompts today...
outcome:
Assistance with GitHub Token:

GITHUB_TOKEN

what goes in the secret?

no what do i write into the secret textbox?

Personal Access Token Name:

in this example what name was used for the token?

my tokens name is SECRET_GHTOKEN

Issues with JAR Artifact Creation:

no artifact is created

no artifact is made when pushing

this is my pom.xml

no you can change it if you then send me the entire code

i did all that and it still doesnt work

still no artifact

Run mvn -B clean package --file pom.xml...

Request for Perfect Instructions:
